Subject: [Rack-core] Poor man's coding style check
Message-ID: <44607D5E.9020302@rts.uni-hannover.de>

Hi all,

I've installed a simple check for our Windows-hosted developers: when
checking in, an SVN hook script will now search for tabs (\t) and DOS
line feed characters (\r) in any *.c, *.h, and *.cpp file of the
commitment. When there are some, committing is rejected.

As I already hear the complaints "I only changed a single line, and now
I cannot check this in quickly", there is an *emergency* by-pass
available: embed the string "[nostyle]" in your commitment messages, and
the hook will leave your changes alone.

In case my script ever causes severe issues: rename the file
/svnroot/repos/rack/hooks/pre-commit on svn.berlios.de to permanently
disable this hook again. If there are further ideas what conventions to
enforce this, just let me know.

Jan

Subject: [Rack-core] Little bug fixed in hooks/pre-commit script
Message-ID: <44608D09.5060902@langenberg-home.de>

The first version of the pre-commit script rejects all checkins in spite
of correct source code:

svn: 'pre-commit' hook failed with error output:
File(s) that did not pass coding style test:
ERROR: 0 file(s) rejected. Reformat your code!

Now the script accept the code: ;-)
    Transmitting file data ...
    Committed revision 43.

Subject: [Rack-core] OpenGrok cross-reference
Message-ID: <4471D762.1010707@rts.uni-hannover.de>

Hi,

I've just set up an OpenGrok cross-reference for current RACK revision #76:

http://www.rts.uni-hannover.de:8080/rack-trunk

This is experimental and does not get updated regularly yet.

Actually, I'm still struggling to find an overall migration concept for
all the projects we have via lxr on our site so far. Will keep you posted.

Jan
