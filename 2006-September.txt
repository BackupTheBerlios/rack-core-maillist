Subject: [Rack-core] [PATCH] Update CAN port abstraction
Message-ID: <44FC14F7.3060707@rts.uni-hannover.de>

Hi,

as a preview of the upcoming CAN changes, here is my current version of
the new CAN port abstraction for RACK. It upgrades the interface to the
revised Socket-CAN API that will be part of Xenomai 2.3 (currently
trunk). Until this version has been released (may take some time
according to our current roadmap), I will keep the patch unapplied in
order to not break existing setups based on the older RT-SJA1000 driver
by Sebastian.

Nevertheless, people already interested in the new stack can give this
patch a try. Don't forget to rebuild the makefiles with autogen.sh after
applying it.

Jan
