Subject: [Rack-core] [ANNOUNCE] RACK 0.4.0 released
Message-ID: <45A5125A.6040108@rts.uni-hannover.de>

Basically, this is closing release for RACK over Xenomai 2.2 and
earlier. We are ready to jump on 2.3, specifically adopting its CAN API.
This step will drop support for older Xenomai versions in order to keep
the code maintainable.

Still, this release contains a number of fixes and enhancements over 0.3.0:

- added datalogger module
- generalised LadarSickCms3000 to Sick's S3xy family
- support for applet-based GUI
- unix'ified installation paths
- kernel-less build (skip TIMS, only generate userland)
- unified angles in Position2D/3D
- extensible module naming for dependent sub-projects
- fixed races in module application startup
- support for strings as module parameters
- uncountable cleanups, refactorings, and fixes

As always, feedback is welcome!
