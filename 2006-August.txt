Hi Folks (& Jan in particular)

As per your suggestion, I checked out the trunk of SVN and proceeded to 
compile & install RACK - Noticed that the AC_INIT_MAKE does a check for AWK, 
so one chunk of the patch I emailed earlier is redundant.. Attached, is an 
updated one.

 Aside from the issues that the patch addresses, I'm getting an error:

paul at Babylon5:/usr/local/rack/gui$ java -jar rack.jar gui.cfg
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: rack/gui/Gui

when trying to run the GUI example - I know very little about java in general, 
and nothing about j2re-1.4.2 in particular (also have the j2sdk from 
Blackdown installed). At a loss as to where to start debugging this, so any 
pointers would be much appreciated.


Regards, Paul.



P.S. After some brutal hacks to configure, managed to compile TiMS and a few 
of the user space libraries on a powerpc (the java stuff didn't like kaffe).

Thanks, merged.

I also tried to address your concerns about uninstalling and cleaned up
a duplicate installation of the map file at this chance. All committed
to SVN now. It's heavily untested, so please give it a careful try. :)

Did you enable CONFIG_RACK_JAVA_GUI? Oli just turned this to "default y"
to make sure no one misses it.

Java 1.4 should not be the problem, some of our installations are based
on it as well.

I copied some arch detections from RTnet to RACK. Let us know if this is
already enough to get it compiling.

Thanks for all feedback,
Jan

Ah, yeah. The directory stuff will be addressed once we restructure the
installation (then most dirs will be common, thus undeletable anyway).

Already tried to build RTnet on some of those systems? I wonder if it
suffers from that as well...

We tried hard but couldn't reconstruct what that -H was once for. Now
it's gone.

It is... :-/

If the user prefers to shoot himself, he's now free to do so - check
removed.

Thanks again,
Jan
